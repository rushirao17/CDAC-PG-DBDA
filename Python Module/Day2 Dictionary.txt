1) accept 5 students name and store them in the dictionary by providing keys from 1 to 5 respectively.
dict1={}
for i in range(5):
	name=input("Enter Name: ")
	dict1[i+1]=name
print(dict1)



2) create a dictionary with pairs
	soap:100
	deo:300
	perfume:400
now accept a product name from user (in any case, so you have to handle "ignore case") and display its price. Also , if the product is not present in the dictionary display the error message " product not available " Note:  you should not get "KeyError:" in the program.

dict1={ 'soap':100, 'deo':300, 'perfume':400 }
n=str.lower(input(""))
if n in dict1.keys():
	print(dict1[n])
else:
    print("Product Not Available")



3) define a class "Student" with members name,age,address and qualification.
   define parameterized constructor and "str" member function which returns all the members
   create 4 objects of Student by passing values.
	now create a dictionary with rollno ( start from 1 ) as a key and student object as a value.
accept a rollno from user and display all its details i.e. name,age,address and qualification.
also display message "student not found" in case if rollno entered by user is not available as a key inside the dictionary.

class Student:
    def __init__(self,name,age,address,qualification):
        self.name=name
        self.age=age
        self.address=address
        self.qualification=qualification

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}, Address: {self.address}, Qualification: {self.qualification}"

s1=Student("Rushi",22,"Chopda","BE")
s2=Student("Harshad",21,"Bhusawal","BE")
s3=Student("Chetan",22,"Jalgaon","CDAC")
s4=Student("Hitesh",21,"Mumbai","ME")

dict1={}
dict1[1]=s1
dict1[2]=s2
dict1[3]=s3
dict1[4]=s4

n=int(input())
if n in dict1.keys():
    print(dict1[n])
else:
    print("Student Not Found")



4)  Given a dictionary of students and their favourite colours: 
people={'Arham':'Blue','Lisa':'Yellow',''Vinod:'Purple','Jenny':'Pink'} 
1. Find out how many students are in the list 
2. Change Lisaâ€™s favourite colour 
3. Remove 'Jenny' and her favourite color
4. Sort and print students and their favourite colours alphabetically by name

people={'Arham':'Blue','Vinod':'Purple','Lisa':'Yellow','Jenny':'Pink'}
print(len(people.keys()))

people['Lisa']="Red"
print(people)

del people["Jenny"]
print(people)

people = dict(sorted(people.items()))
print(people)
